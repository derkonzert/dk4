## Who's behind derkonzert?

Next to many friends, helping me with their feedback and ideas, the website is developed and maintained by myself ([Ju](https://ju.am/)) privately.

## The project

Under the code name "dk4", this already is the fourth version of derkonzert.

Since it is a hobby project, it might take some time to fix potential bugs and stuffâ€¦ But I usually try to maintain everything as quickly as possible. All code is open-source and therefore publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/derkonzert/dk4).
